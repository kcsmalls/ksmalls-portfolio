    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a technical writer with experience creating clear, concise content for both hardware and software applications. I produce and manage documentation projects across Agile and Waterfall environments, ensuring high-quality deliverables that meet user needs and project goals.</p>

    <p>My background includes developing end-user documentation from requirements, specifications, and subject matter expert interviews, as well as applying a Docs-as-Code approach to streamline content creation and management. Skilled at multi-tasking, I have successfully overseen multiple documentation projects simultaneously while maintaining accuracy, consistency, and usability.</p>

    <p>I also hold an inactive TS/SCI security clearance, reflecting my ability to work on projects requiring discretion and trust. See my writing <a href="writing-samples.html">portfolio.</a></p>
